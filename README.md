# Cancer-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Problem 
Suppose you are given a medical data set on cancer. The data set has 645 instances with 164 patients diagnosed with cancer and remaining are non-cancerian patients. Let there are explanatory and an out- come variables present in the data set. The domain experts in an traditional approach analyse explanatory variables in order to predict possibility of cancer. How can this traditional approach be replaced by an automated discovery of novel knowledge using machine learning models? The objective is to present domain expert knowledge that is new and meaningful to them. Domain expert may already know which explanatory variables have direct correlation with presence/absence of cancer. Machine learning results with such kind of known knowledge will not be beneficial to the experts. The aim is to apply machine learning models suitable for the problem, discover hidden patterns present in the data set with high cor- relation with the outcome variable and analyse the results.

Instructions on the data set: 
1. Features I, M, O,S, AB,AP,AQ, BF, BA, BP, BT, BU, CJ, CK, CR, CT, CU, CV, CW, DA, DB, DC, DD, DH, DI, DK, DL, DM, DN, DS, EA , ED and EG are most relevant. 
2. Feature DO is the outcome. It has three classes namely 0, 1 and 2. You can delete class 2 in this study.
